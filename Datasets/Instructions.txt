Each dataset folder contains:
- datacenters.csv
- measurements-1party.csv
- measurements-3party.csv (same file as measurements-1party.csv)
- servers-1party.csv (including the true locations of the files)
- servers-3party.csv (excluding the true locations of the files)
- solution.csv


The algorithm expects:
- measurements-1party.csv
- measurements-3party.csv
- servers-1party.csv (including the true locations of the files)
- servers-3party.csv (excluding the true locations of the files)
- data_centers.csv
- solution.csv (optional)


To use the algorithm with DS-F3 as 1st-party, and DS-F4 as 3rd-party:
- use DS-F3/measurements-1party.csv as measurements-1party.csv
- use DS-F3/servers-1party.csv as servers-1party.csv
- use DS-F4/measurements-3party.csv as measurements-3party.csv
- use DS-F4/servers-3party.csv as servers-3party.csv
- use DS-F4/data_centers.csv as data_centers.csv
- optionally, use DS-F4/solution.csv as solution.csv to test the accuracy
